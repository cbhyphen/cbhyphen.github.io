When I first saw it, it smelled a lot like DP and the [Maximum Subarray Sum problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_subarray_problem) that I had seen in my graduate algorithms class.  After solving it, I realized the DP approach wasn't entirely obvious to most people who attempted the problem.  The official solution even misses presenting it this way, so in this post I want to go through that problem/solution framing and explain how/why it works."

We can't use this as a drop-in solution to the buy and sell problem though, as it would give us a sum of prices (could call it the most expensive period) instead of profits.  However, if you take daily price differences, then you can use the same approach."
