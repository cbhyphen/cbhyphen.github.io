        "It's pretty difficult to escape recommender systems in 2024.  These days, we regularly get recommended things such as content from streaming services like Netflix and products from online shopping platforms like Amazon.  Even if you don't know the term recommender systems, there's a good chance you understand what it does.\n",
        "\n",
        "I first heard about recommender systems in the context of the [Netflix prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix_Prize) which was an open competition in 2009 for best collaborative filtering (CF) algorithm.  The challenge was to improve upon Netflix's existing recommender system by at least `0.10 RMSE` and the winner was awarded $1MM.  Around that time, [nearest neighbor techniques were popular](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01860) CF methods however, the winners of the Netflix prize proved that [matrix factorization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_factorization) (MF) models were superior.  MF models have some similarity to singular value decomposition (SVD) but can handle sparsity often seen with recommender system datasets whereas SVD can't.\n",
        "\n",
        "To understand more about MF and recommender systems, in this post I'll be creating an algorithm from scratch and evaluating it's performance on the [MovieLens 20M dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/grouplens/movielens-20m-dataset) (see [here](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/20m/) for more info).  In particular, I'll be implementing probabilistic matrix factorization (PMF) which was a seminal improvement over previous MF techniques because of it's ability to handle sparsity and scale linearly with data ([see paper here](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2007/file/d7322ed717dedf1eb4e6e52a37ea7bcd-Paper.pdf)).\n",

        "\n",
        "Before diving into a mathematical derivation, let me provide some intuition about how MF works.\n",
        "\n",
        "In a ratings scenario we have some number of `n` users and `m` movies.  This can be represented with an `n x m` matrix where values of the matrix are the ranking a person gave to a movie.  For simplicity, let's say the value is a 1 if they watched and liked the movie otherwise it's a 0.  Most people will only watch a handful of movies so there'll be many missing values in the matrix.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the ratings matrix, each user can be described by the sparse vector of 1's (mostly 0's) that indicate the movies they liked (or the users that liked them in the case of movie vectors).  But we can use a more compact representation similar to how one-hot encoded words are condensed via word embeddings.  This allows for better comparison if we want to use something like cosine similarity to compare users, for example.\n",
        "\n",
        "The dense representations of users and movies will form two smaller matrices, an `n x d` user matrix and an `m x d` movie matrix where `d << n` and `d << m`.  You can see from a quick dimensionality analysis that the product of these two smaller matrices could be an approximation for the original ratings matrix.  In fact, we could minimize the difference between the approximation and the true rating in an optimization process.  Once we've done that, we would even have an estimate of the rating a user might have given a movie even if they didn't watch it.  And the movie with the highest likelihood of a positive rating, well we can recommend that to a user.  So at a high level, that's exactly what I'm going to do here with MF."

        "The baseline RMSE that Netflix had achieved before the competition was `0.95`.  This beats that by a small margin but the dataset is different so it's not an apples to apples comparison.  Also, the range of ratings goes down to `0.5` in the MovieLens dataset whereas prediction mapping was consistent with the paper and Netflix dataset which had a range of `[1, 5]`.  This was mostly an exercise in understanding PMF and implementing an algorithm based off an objective function in a research paper.  But, if we wanted to squeeze out more performance there are several things we could do:\n",

        "- map predictions to `[0.5, 5]`\n",
        "- use adaptive covariance (biggest gains)\n",
        "- tune the lambda regularization coefficients (I started with `1` and only went up/down by an order of magnitude)\n",
        "- separate covariances for users and movies\n",
        "- diagonal covariance matrix (instead of spherical) to account for different variation between latent features"
